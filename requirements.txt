# Core Hugging Face libraries
# Consider specifying a minimum version if certain features are needed,
# e.g., transformers>=4.30.0
# For broader compatibility initially, can leave versions open or use ranges.
# Given the copied UnbatchedClassifierFreeGuidanceLogitsProcessor, a relatively recent transformers version is good.
transformers>=4.35.0
optimum[onnxruntime]>=1.16.0

# Tokenizers is often a dependency of transformers
tokenizers>=0.14.0

# Sentencepiece might be needed by some tokenizers used by transformers

# PyTorch (torch) is a fundamental requirement for ComfyUI and transformers.
# Usually, users will have this installed as part of their ComfyUI setup.
# Listing it here can ensure it's considered if pip needs to resolve versions,
# but typically we don't force a specific torch version that might conflict with ComfyUI's base.
